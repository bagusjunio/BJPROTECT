INTRODUCTION AND ACCEPTING THE TERMS
Welcome to Discord! These Terms of Service (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù), which include and hereby incorporate the Privacy Policy at https://discord.com/privacy (‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù), are a legal agreement between Discord Inc. and its related companies (the ‚ÄúCompany,‚Äù ‚Äúus,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or "we") and you ("you" or ‚Äúyour‚Äù). By using or accessing the Discord application (the ‚ÄúApp‚Äù) or the website located at https://discord.com (the "Site"), which are collectively referred to as the ‚ÄúService,‚Äù you agree (i) that you are 13 years of age and the minimum age of digital consent in your country, (ii) if you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by the Terms, and (iii) if you are between 13 (or the minimum age of digital consent, as applicable) and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms.

The Company reserves the right to update these Terms, which we may do for reasons that include, but are not limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting enhancements to Discord. If the changes affect your usage of Discord or your legal rights, we‚Äôll notify you no less than seven days before the changes take effect.

If you submit a notice of infringement that knowingly materially misrepresents that any Content, information, or communication on the Services is infringing upon a copyright, you may be held liable for damages and attorneys‚Äô fees.

Counter-Notice. If you believe that Your Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner‚Äôs agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in Your Content, you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:

your physical or electronic signature;
identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and

VIRTUAL CURRENCIES, VIRTUAL GOODS, AND TERMS OF SALE

The Service may include an opportunity to obtain virtual currency ("Virtual Currency") or virtual goods ("Virtual Goods") that may require you to pay a fee using legal tender (that is, "real money") to obtain the Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods. Your purchase of Virtual Currency is final and is not refundable, exchangeable, transferable, except in the Company‚Äôs or the platform provider‚Äôs sole discretion.

Prices and availability of Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. We shall have no liability to you or any third party for the exercise of such rights. You shall have a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable permission to use solely within the Service Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency that you have earned, purchased or otherwise obtained in a manner authorized by the Company. You have no other right, title or interest in or to any such Virtual Goods or Virtual Currency appearing or originating in the Service.

Product Descriptions. We try to make the Service thorough, accurate, and helpful to our customers. Nonetheless, there may be times when certain information contained on the Service may be incorrect, incomplete, or inaccurate, or appear inaccurate because of the browser, hardware, software, or other technology that you use. Discord reserves the right, with or without prior notice, to: change descriptions or references to products and/or services; limit the available quantity of any product or service; honor, or refuse to honor, any coupon, coupon code, promotional code or other similar promotions; and/or refuse to provide any visitor to, or use of the Service with any product or service.

Availability and Pricing. Though we try to honor all purchase requests, availability cannot always be guaranteed. When an item is not available and cannot be replenished ‚Äî for example, if we offer a limited promotion ‚Äî we will attempt to remove the item from the Service in a timely manner but make no guarantees in this regard. We may occasionally make errors in the stated prices on the Service. If a product‚Äôs correct price is higher than the listed price, we will either confirm that we‚Äôll provide the item at the price listed or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation.

Payments. We accept major credit cards, certain debit cards, PayPal, and/or such other payment methods we may make available to you from time-to-time through our Service, as forms of payment (‚ÄúPayment Method‚Äù). We may also offer you the ability to make orders through a third party app store or other payment service. You agree to comply with their terms and any other requirements they may have. By submitting an order, you authorize Discord, or its designated payment processor, to charge the account you specify for the purchase amount.

We may, in our sole discretion, cancel your payment at any time by providing notice to you through your contact information or by a notice when you attempt to make a payment. We may cancel a payment or prevent you from initiating future payments for any reason, including, without limitation, the following: (i) if you attempt to use the Service in breach of any applicable law or regulation, including the card network rules or regulations; (ii) if you use the Service in breach of these Terms; (iii) if we suspect fraudulent, unlawful or improper activity regarding a payment; (iv) if we detect, in our sole discretion, that your payments have excessive disputes, high reversal rates or present a relatively high risk of losses; or (v) failure to cooperate in an investigation or provide additional information when requested.

Refunds. You can find our refund policy here: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071

Taxes. Stated prices may not include sales and use taxes. If they do not, you are responsible for the payment of such taxes related to your purchase. We have the right to charge you for any taxes that we are required to pay or in fact collect related to your purchase.

International Orders. You will be solely responsible for any license fees, customs duties, and other taxes and fees related to the export of the products from the United States.

Manufacturer EULAs and Other Terms. You may be required to accept an end user license agreement (EULA) or other terms provided by the manufacturer prior to use of the product you ordered. A EULA or other terms may accompany the product you ordered.

NITRO SUBSCRIPTIONS
Recurring Billing. By purchasing a Nitro subscription, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method on a recurring (e.g., monthly or yearly) basis for the applicable Nitro subscription charge, any and all taxes or possible transaction fees, and any other charges incurred in connection with your use of the Nitro subscription service. Your payment to Discord will automatically renew at the end of your applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period.

Price Changes. Discord may change the price for Nitro subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Nitro subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use Nitro after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from Nitro prior to the price change going into effect. We don‚Äôt want to charge you for something you don‚Äôt want, though, so if you cancel within 14 days of any price increases, we‚Äôll provide you a refund.

Cancellation. You may cancel your Nitro subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to Nitro through the end of the current subscription period. If you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us. At our sole discretion, however, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance. To cancel, go to the "User Settings" screen in the Discord desktop or mobile app and follow the instructions for cancellation.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
THIS SECTION AND THE NEXT SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

You and Discord agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions.

Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to arbitration. In the event of a dispute, you agree to provide us notice of the dispute. This notice must provide a brief, written description of the dispute, the relief requested and the contact information of the party giving it. You must send any such notice to Discord by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.

The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with one another, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, disputes concerning patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Site shall not be subject to arbitration, and the notice and good faith negotiation required by this paragraph shall not apply to these types of disputes.

Binding Arbitration. Except as provided herein, if we cannot resolve a dispute informally, any dispute will be resolved only by binding arbitration to be held in the U.S. state in which you reside. For residents outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco, California. Discord and you further agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court in San Francisco, California to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, governed by the rules of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (referred to as the ‚ÄúJAMS Rules‚Äù) and under the rules set forth in these Terms. If there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms will govern. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to your state‚Äôs law.

To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Discord will pay the additional cost. Discord shall also bear the cost of any arbitration fees, unless the arbitrator finds your claims, defenses, or other fee-generating activity to be asserted or conducted for an improper purpose or frivolous. You are responsible for all other additional costs that you may incur in the arbitration including, without limitation, attorney‚Äôs fees and expert witness costs unless Discord is specifically required to pay such fees under applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator will be in writing and binding and conclusive on Discord and you, and judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. Discord and you agree that dispositive motions, including without limitation motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment, will be allowed in the arbitration. The arbitrator must follow these Terms of Service and can award the same damages and relief as a court, including injunctive or other equitable relief and attorney‚Äôs fees. Discord and you understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, Discord and you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. Discord and you further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

If Discord‚Äôs or your claim is solely for monetary relief of $10,000 or less and does not include a request for any type of equitable remedy, the party bringing the claim may choose whether the arbitration of the claim will be conducted, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the JAMS Rules, solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator.

You or Discord may choose to pursue a claim in small claims court where jurisdiction and venue over you and Discord otherwise qualifies for such small claims court and where the claim does not include a request for any type of equitable relief. However, if you decide to pursue a claim in small claims court, you agree to still provide Discord with advance notice by email to disputes@discord.com and by U.S. Mail to Discord Inc., 444 De Haro Street #200, San Francisco, CA 94107.

Opt-Out Right. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to arbitration-opt-out@discord.com. The notice must be sent within 90 days of this Terms of Service taking effect, or your account creation on the Service. If you do not opt out via this method, you will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the provisions requiring arbitration, Discord will not be bound by them either. If any clause within this Arbitration Section is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that specific clause will be severed from this section, and the remainder of its provisions will be given full force and effect.

Survival. This Arbitration section shall survive any termination of your account or the Service.

CLASS WAIVER
THIS SECTION AND THE PREVIOUS SECTION ONLY APPLIES TO YOU IF YOU ARE A UNITED STATES RESIDENT.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.

Discord and you agree to resolve any dispute in an individual capacity, and not on behalf of, or as part of, any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.

The arbitrator cannot combine more than one person‚Äôs or entity‚Äôs claims into a single case, and cannot preside over any consolidated, class or representative proceeding (unless we agree otherwise). And, the arbitrator‚Äôs decision or award in one person‚Äôs or entity‚Äôs case can only impact the person or entity that brought the claim, not other Discord customers, and cannot be used to decide other disputes with other customers.

If any court or arbitrator determines that the class/consolidated/representative action waiver set forth in this section is void or unenforceable for any reason or that arbitration can proceed on a class, consolidated, or representative basis, then the disputes, claims, or controversies will not be subject to arbitration and must be litigated in federal court located in San Francisco, California.

This Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your account or the Services.

INTERNATIONAL USE; EXPORT CONTROLS
Software available in connection with the Service and the transmission of applicable data, if any, is subject to United States export controls. No software may be downloaded from the Service or otherwise exported or re-exported in violation of U.S. export laws. Downloading or using the software is at your sole risk. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules and laws regarding your use of the Service, including as it concerns online conduct and acceptable content.

You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Discord only, and not with Apple, Inc. (‚ÄúApple‚Äù).
Your use of the Company‚Äôs iOS App must comply with Apple‚Äôs then-current App Store Terms of Service.
The Company, and not Apple, are solely responsible for our iOS App and the Services and Content available thereon. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance and support services with respect to our iOS App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to our iOS App.
You agree that the Company, and not Apple, are responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third-party relating to our iOS App or your possession and/or use of our iOS App.
You agree that the Company, and not Apple, shall be responsible, to the extent required by these Terms, for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third-party intellectual property infringement claim related to our iOS App or your possession and use of our iOS App.
You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a ‚Äúterrorist supporting‚Äù country; and (ii) You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
You agree to comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using our iOS App (e.g., you must not be in violation of your wireless data service terms of agreement when using the iOS App).
The parties agree that Apple and Apple‚Äôs subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries to these Terms as they relate to your license of the Company‚Äôs iOS App. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as they relate to your license of the iOS App as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
GENERAL
Governing Law. By visiting or using the Service, you agree that the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws and regardless of your location, will govern these Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and the Company.

Any claim or dispute between you and the Company that arises out of or is related to the Service and is not subject to arbitration shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of San Francisco County, California.

Injunctive and Other Equitable Relief. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made to the Company under these Terms are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which remedies at law are inadequate. The Company shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligation to post any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.

Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company with respect to your use of the Service and any other subject matter hereof and cannot be changed or modified by you except as expressly posted on the Service by the Company. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software.

Waiver. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, and no waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.

Severability. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.

Course of Conduct/Trade Practice. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify these Terms.

Assignment. These Terms may not be assigned by you without the Company's prior written consent, but are freely assignable by the Company. Subject to the foregoing restriction, these Terms will be binding on, inure to, and enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

Documentation of Compliance. Upon the Company's request, you will furnish the Company with any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms.

Interpretation. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against the Company by virtue of having drafted them.

Defenses Based on Electronic Form of These Terms. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms.

Survival. You agree that the provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive any termination of these Terms.

Contact. If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact privacy@discord.com.

Discord is made possible through the work of other open source software.


Discord Developer Terms of Service
Effective date: August 18, 2020
Posted date: July 15, 2020
For a link to the previous terms, please see here.

Welcome to Discord‚Äôs APIs, software development kits (‚ÄúSDKs‚Äù), and associated documentation (collectively, "APIs").

Throughout this document, we use the word ‚ÄúTerms‚Äù to refer to the terms below, terms within the accompanying API and SDK documentation, our Discord Developer Policy, and any applicable policies and guidelines. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict.

Section 1: Acceptance of the Terms and Registration
a. Accepting the Terms
By accessing or using our APIs you are agreeing to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. You are also agreeing that (i) you are 13 years of age and the minimum age of digital consent in your country, (ii) if you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read, understood, and accept to be bound by the Terms, and (iii) if you are between 13 (or the minimum age of digital consent, as applicable) and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to these Terms. Please read all the Terms carefully.

You may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs.

If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to "you" in the Terms refer to that entity).

b. Registration
In order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. You must provide accurate and up-to-date registration information at all times. We will use the information you submit in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

Section 2: User Privacy and Security.
a. Implement Good Privacy Practices.
You will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personally identifiable information ("PII"). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your application that uses the API (your ‚ÄúAPI Client‚Äù) that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information with Discord and third parties.

b. Implement Good Security.
You will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect data collected by your API Client, including PII, from unauthorized access or use. These efforts will include, but are not limited to, encryption of this data at rest. You will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.

Section 3: API Clients and Monitoring
The APIs are designed to help you enhance your API Client. You agree to respond promptly to our requests to verify and audit your compliance with these Terms. YOU AGREE THAT DISCORD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DISCORD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include Discord accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Discord or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Discord may use any technical means to overcome such interference.

Section 4: IP, DMCA, and Confidentiality
a. IP Ownership, Open Source, and Feedback
Discord does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.

Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Discord for the applicable open source software.

If you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.

b. Discord DMCA Policy
We can't determine whether something is being used legally or not without copyright holder‚Äôs input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Discord's policy about responding to notices in our Terms of Service.

c. Confidential Matters
Developer credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client secrets) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.
Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Discord confidential information. Discord confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without Discord's prior written consent unless required by law with reasonable prior notice to us (unless a court orders that we not receive notice).
Section 5: Content
a. Content Accessible Through our APIs
Our APIs contain some third-party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available and you are solely responsible for your decision to use or distribute any of this content. While we may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content, we make no representations or warranties about the content, its appropriateness, legality, pedigree or other details. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.

b. Submission of Content
Some of our APIs allow the submission of content. Discord does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in these Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling Discord to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable Discord privacy policies, you give Discord a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. "Use" means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.

Section 6: Brand Features; Attribution
a. Brand Features
"Brand Features" is defined as the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by you of Discord‚Äôs Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of Discord. All use by us of your Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to your benefit.

b. Attribution
You agree to display any attribution(s) required by Discord as described in the documentation for the API. Discord hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display Discord‚Äôs Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs. You must only use the Discord Brand Features in accordance with the Terms and for the purpose of fulfilling your obligations under this Section. In using Discord‚Äôs Brand Features, you must follow the Discord Brand Features Use Guidelines. You understand and agree that Discord has the sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of Discord's Brand Features are in accordance with the above requirements and guidelines.

c. Publicity
You will not make any statement regarding your use of an API which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Discord without a Discord officer‚Äôs prior written approval.

d. Promotional and Marketing Use
In the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and the associated Discord products, Discord may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.

Section 7: Termination
a. Termination
You may stop using our APIs at any time with or without notice. Discord reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto if you violate any of these Terms, if we believe your Application harms us or our users, or at our convenience upon notice to you.

b. Your Obligations Post-Termination
Upon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the Discord Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored data collected by your API Client. Discord may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.

c. Surviving Provisions
When the Terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to: Sections 4b, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

Section 8: Liability for our APIs
a. WARRANTIES
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS, NEITHER DISCORD NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED OR MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE APIS, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIS, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APIs "AS IS".

SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.

b. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCORD, AND DISCORD‚ÄôS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA; FINANCIAL LOSSES; OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DISCORD, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE APIS (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE APIS AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

IN ALL CASES, DISCORD, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

c. Indemnification
Unless prohibited by applicable law, you will defend and indemnify Discord, and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and users, against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:

your actual or alleged misuse or your end users‚Äô misuse of the APIs;
your actual or alleged violation or your end users‚Äô violation of the Terms;
your actual or alleged infringement of any third party‚Äôs intellectual property rights or rights to privacy or publicity; or
any content or data routed into or used with the APIs by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.
Section 9: General Provisions
a. Modification
We may change these Terms from time to time. If we make a material change to the Terms, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect at the email address or Discord ID we have on file for you. You can review the most current version of these Terms at any time by visiting this page. The materially revised Terms will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and all other changes will become effective upon posting of the change. Also, changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

b. U.S. Federal Agency Entities
The APIs were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.

c. Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution
Except as set forth below the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs.

This Agreement shall be interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its principles of conflicts of law. If you have a dispute with Discord arising out of or in connection with the subject matter covered by these Terms, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we aren‚Äôt able to resolve the dispute informally, you and we each agree that any claim or dispute between you and the Company that arises in whole or in part from these Terms or your use of the API shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts of San Francisco County, California.

If you are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States city, county, or state government entity, then the following applies instead of the paragraph above: the parties agree to remain silent regarding governing law and venue.

d. General Legal Terms
We each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Discord does not take action right away, this does not mean that Discord is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Discord relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. For information about how to contact Discord, please visit our Terms of Service.

You may not assign, sublicense or delegate any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to any third party without the prior written consent of Discord. Any assignment, sublicense or delegation in violation of this provision is null and void. Any change of control or material ownership of you is hereby deemed an assignment. These Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that Discord may develop products or services that may compete with the API Clients or any other products or services.

"Discord" means Discord Inc., with offices in San Francisco, California unless set forth otherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to "Discord" as "we", "our", or "us" in the Terms.
